# AI Agent with Qwen 2.5 3B Model via Ollama

## 🧠 Project Overview

This AI Agent leverages the **Qwen 2.5 3B** language model, a powerful 3-billion-parameter LLM, running locally via **Ollama**. The agent understands natural language commands, performs multi-step tasks, and provides intelligent responses by interacting with Qwen 2.5 3B through Ollama’s lightweight local deployment.

## 🚀 Features

- Uses **Qwen 2.5 3B** model hosted on **Ollama** for fast and efficient inference  
- Supports natural language understanding and task automation  
- Modular design for adding new capabilities and integrations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+  
- Ollama for hosting and running the Qwen 2.5 3B model locally  
- Qwen 2.5 3B via Ollama  
- LangChain or custom orchestration logic

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
